Hello, my name is Guigui Salma and I am curretly majoring in data engineering at ENSIAS . I worked on a merried of projects regarding data science but as i start a clean journey into the realm of data engineering i build this github profile. You'll find some full-stack projects in here in the near futur but it's only for my leisure.
I should also mention that i switched sides to data engineering because i love it more and if something gonna take of your time, it better brings you joy, if not bring the joy out of it!

- 💬 Also tryna learn Blender cause why not.
